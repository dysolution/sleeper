/*
Package sleepwalker is a simple REST client.

It was extracted from an SDK the author built while learning Go. No claim is
made as to the quality or utility of this code. It's safe to assume there are
more fully featured and better-written Go REST clients available.

The code is in a pre-release state and is subject to (drastically) change as
its interface between the SDK client and other related packages is discovered
and refined.
